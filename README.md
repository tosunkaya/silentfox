I decided to fork and maintain this userChrome.css because it was no longer being developed (I don't like dead projects). I'm weak in CSS so I won't be able to improve everything. I am updating the README too. Peace ✌️.

## The Goal
This is silentfox, it is a fork of the now dead project called quietfox. I decided to update it and maintain it.

## But what is this??
This is a userChrome.css theme to make your firefox look a lot more cleaner then it was.

## Customizable values 
Simply open userChrome.css in a text editor and change the values at the top of the file. Restart Firefox to see changes.

## How to install
1. [Download](https://github.com/themoonmeetsthesun/silentfox/releases/latest) and unzip
2. Go to `about:support` in Firefox and open your Profile Folder
3. Drop your unzipped "chrome" folder and user.js (I have included the about:config tweak so you don't need to change it) into the folder that appears
4. Restart Firefox

Tested with Firefox 99

### Older version
If you need Quietfox for an older version of Firefox, you can find the older userChrome.css files in the "old" folder

## P. S.
If you have any issues you can post the issue in the issues section.
A big thanks to coekuss for making this wonderful thing.
